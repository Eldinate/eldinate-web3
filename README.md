# Eldinate Web3

You need to call a JavaScript library to implement the Eldinate Web2.0 and Web3.0 protocol and to provide the connection that we describe as a middleware. You can simply connect to the Web3 infrastructure by calling the code below (the one that suits you).

## Get Started

```http
  CDN | https://cdn.eldinate.org/js/web3.js 
```

If you don't like calling a library, you can download the eldinate-web3.js file from our GitHub library and host it in your server files.
